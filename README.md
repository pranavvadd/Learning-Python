## **Highlighted Projects**

### **1. Alarm Clock**
The Alarm Clock project is a simple yet functional application that allows users to set alarms and receive notifications. It demonstrates:
- **Time manipulation** using Python's `datetime` module.
- **Event handling** for triggering alarms.
- A clean and intuitive user interface built with PyQt5.

### **2. Pokemon API**
The Pokemon API project integrates with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display information about Pokémon. It showcases:
- **API requests** using Python's `requests` library.
- **JSON parsing** to extract and format data.
- A user-friendly interface for searching and viewing Pokémon details.

### **3. Digital Clock**
The Digital Clock project is a GUI-based application that displays the current time in real-time. It highlights:
- **Timers** and event loops using PyQt5's `QTimer`.
- **Dynamic updates** to the GUI for real-time functionality.
- A visually appealing design with custom styles.

### **4. LineEdit GUI**
The LineEdit GUI project is a simple text input application that allows users to enter text and submit it. It demonstrates:
- **Basic GUI design** using PyQt5.
- **Event handling** for button clicks.
- **Text input and retrieval** using `QLineEdit`.
